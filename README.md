imapsync_bash
=============

This is just a basic shell script, to use with imapsync and migrate emails from imapserver A to imapserver B.

Please, edit the file before use it!! And use --dry to test, before do it for real.

Usage:

Create a file users.txt with the following model:
<userimapA>;<passwordimapA>;<userimapB>;<passwordimapB>

Where:
imapA - MailServer as source
imapB - MailServer as destination
userimapA - e.g. test@lala1
userimapB - e.g. test@lala2

This is an independent project, without relationship with Imapsync Developers, use and customize as your OWN risk.
